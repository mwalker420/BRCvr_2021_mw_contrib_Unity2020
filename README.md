# BRCvr 2021 Contribution Project
This is a Unity project containing contributions to the [BRCvr](https://brcvr.org) event for 2021. It's my trial-by-fire attempt to get into 3D Modeling, Shader development and VR in general.

This Unity project is based on Unity version 2020.3.9 with unity-uploader verision 0.9.2 for deployment to [AltspaceVR](https://altvr.com).

I'm using [Amplify Shader Editor](http://amplify.pt/unity/amplify-shader-editor/) for learning and development.

You can find blender source files in [Assets/Blender](Assets/Blender) for the various models.

This is all pretty new to me so if there are any suggestions for improvement please leave me a note.

You can find this world on Altspace [https://account.altvr.com/worlds/1706931531869586246/spaces/1749710479829238671](https://account.altvr.com/worlds/1706931531869586246/spaces/1749710479829238671) or enter world code: AEX679
